  abstract = {The Lunar Global Navigation Satellite System (LGNSS) could significantly improve lunar missions' operational capability and flexibility by providing real-time, continuous, and highly accurate positioning services to lunar users. To achieve accurate user positioning, the orbit and clock bias of the navigation satellites have to be estimated accurately. An effective way to accurately estimate the orbit of navigation satellites in the lunar fixed frame is to process the psudorange data generated from the received navigation signals at lunar monitoring stations (LMSs) on the lunar surface. This paper presents a method to simulate the orbit determination error of the navigation satellites and the positioning error of the lunar user, assuming the usage of LMSs. We also propose a method to optimize the satellite constellation and LMS configuration to minimize the user positioning error. When optimizing, we reduced the number of design parameters by assuming the geometric symmetry of the navigation satellite constellation and LMS arrangement. Considering the sensitivity of the LMS arrangement and satellite constellation on the user positioning error, step by step optimization method is proposed. In the proposed method, the candidate constellation is first narrowed down by satellite visibility and PDOP analysis, followed by the LMS arrangement optimization for the selected constellations. Finally, the user positioning accuracy performance of the optimized configuration for 20 navigation satellites and 8 LMSs is analyzed. The results showed that the obtained constellation could achieve positioning errors below 10m in 3$\sigma$ for the global average.},

              heater wattage to achieve the required thrust value. Secondly, at the observation phase around

              resistojet propulsion system adopted for trajectory control and angular momentum unloading
              of EQUULEUS makes the thermal design more difficult in terms of freezing and the latent

Three convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures are trained with binary (safe or unsafe) safety maps and multi-hazard-class safety maps. Their performance is compared together with a replicated state-of-the-art (SOA) HD algorithm from NASA's Autonomous Landing Hazard Avoidance Technology (ALHAT) project. To train and test each method, we prepared a dataset that is rich enough to reproduce the fine hazardous features by developing a realistic Digital Elevation Map (DEM) generator. Our DEM generator produces realistic terrains in arbitrary high resolution and the safeness of each pixel of DEMs is examined by computing the maximum possible slope and roughness for a given lander geometry and landing attitude. The results show that all three CNN architectures perform better than the replicated SOA HD algorithm for noised DEMs. The networks trained with multi-hazard-class safety maps result in better accuracy in terms of mean intersection over union (mIoU) but do not improve pixel accuracy. },

  abstract = {This paper demonstrates an algorithmic framework for autonomous, distributed navigation and timekeeping for spacecraft swarms and constellations using angles-only measurements from onboard cameras. 
              Angles-only methods are compelling as they reduce reliance on external measurement sources. However, prior flight demonstrations have faced limitations, 
              including 1) inability to treat multi-agent space systems including multiple observers and targets in an accurate and timely manner, 2) lack of autonomy and reliance on external state information, 
              and 3) treatment of primarily Earth-orbiting scenarios. 
              The Absolute and Relative Trajectory Measurement System (ARTMS) discussed in this paper overcomes these challenges to enable future lunar missions. 
              It consists of three novel algorithms: 1) Image Processing, which tracks and identifies targets in images and computes their bearing angles; 2) Batch Orbit Determination, which computes a swarm state initialization from angles-only measurements; 
              and 3) Sequential Orbit Determination, which uses an unscented Kalman filter to refine the swarm state, seamlessly fusing measurements from multiple observers to achieve the necessary robustness and autonomy. 
              This paper augments ARTMS for lunar navigation and its theoretical performance is investigated through a quantitative observability analysis. High-fidelity simulations with a star tracker in the loop demonstrate successful navigation of swarms and constellations in low lunar orbits, near-rectilinear halo orbits, and elliptic frozen orbits. 
              ARTMS achieves absolute orbit estimation for all swarm members using only inter-satellite angles with simultaneous estimation of differential clock offsets and ballistic coefficients. 
              It therefore presents an important capability for the support of future lunar and planetary exploration.},

                  Recently, NASA has awarded a $14.1 million contract to Nokia for developing a 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE) network on the Moon. 
                  In particular, there has been a great emphasis on designing a low-power and an ultra-compact LTE solution for the future Lunar Surface Communication Network (LSCN) 
                  due to its ease of transportation and potential for scalable deployment on the lunar surface. Ensuring a reliable LSCN design requires the base stations to be time-synchronized,
                  and to maintain a precise globally referenced timing standard. We propose an LSCN design with distributed time-transfer from Earth-GPS to maintain precise timing across the network. 
                  We design a diffusion Kalman filter framework that utilizes the intermittently available Earth-GPS signals and the crosslink signals exchanged among the LSCN base stations to facilitate
                  global time synchronization, while alleviating the timing stability and SWaP requirements for the on-site clocks.
                  We validate our proposed technique by simulating the Earth-GPS satellites and multiple base stations near the Moon's Haworth Crater using the Systems Tool Kit (STK) software.
                  We simulate the visibility and carrier-to-noise-density ratio of the Earth-GPS satellites at each LSCN base station, while examining the timing accuracy performance when each base station is equipped with a low-SWaP Chip Scale Atomic Clock (CSAC). 
                  We demonstrate the robustness of our distributed time-transfer technique as the error covariance of the transmission delay is varied.},

              designed a PNT framework that tackles the three challenges above. First, to robustly make the filter converge in a low-observable
              system, the proposed PNT framework estimates the absolute and relative states in two separate filters, where filter settings (e.g.,
              process noise) can be tuned separately. Second, to remove the signal-in-space errors, the proposed filter utilizes three different
              differential measurements. The absolute filter estimates time-differenced carrier phase (TDCP) measurements in combination
              with the pseudorange and pseudorange rate measurements, avoiding the need for estimating the integer ambiguity terms that
              are low observable. The relative filter estimates the relative orbit and clock offsets by processing the single difference carrier
              phase (SDCP) measurements, where signal-in-space errors are removed thanks to the short inter-satellite distance compared to
              the Earth-Moon distance. Using the obtained single difference float ambiguity estimate, the relative filter also fixes the integer
              ambiguities in double difference carrier phase (DDCP) measurements to improve the relative orbit estimates. Finally, cycleslip
              corrupted carrier-phase measurements are removed by observing the residuals in the TDCP measurements. We demonstrate
              the filter’s performance through simulations of two closely operating lunar satellites with different clock grades in the elliptical
              lunar frozen orbit (ELFO), wherein we showcase higher positioning and timing accuracy compared to code phase-only PNT
              methods.}

  abstract = {Plans to establish a satellite network around the Moon to support communication, position, navigation, and timing services are
              rapidly evolving. Satellites that are part of this system broadcast their ephemeris as finite parameters to lunar users for user
              state estimation. We investigate lunar satellite ephemeris parameterization to identify the optimal parameterization to broadcast
              to a lunar user. The proposed framework directly approximates the lunar satellite position and velocity in the inertial frame,
              along with approximating conversion parameters necessary for representation in the lunar fixed frame. The framework leverages
              signal-in-space-error requirements as constraints in the approximation process to guide the search for the best parameterization.
              We evaluate the performance of our proposed framework for satellites in a Low Lunar Orbit and an Elliptical Lunar Frozen
              Orbit. The performance of different methods is assessed based on the precision of the ephemeris prediction, approximation
              interval, and message size. We showcase the ability of the developed framework to approximate satellite ephemeris for both
              orbits to the desired precision by adjusting the approximation period and the number of broadcasted parameters. Particularly,
              we demonstrate that model formulations with a standard polynomial basis and a Chebyshev polynomial basis produce feasible
              solutions for ephemeris approximation at varying epochs in orbits, abiding by stringent signal-in-space-error requirements.},

  abstract = {Future deep space exploration stands to benefit significantly from networks of small satellites, given their
              cost-effective communication and monitoring capabilities. However,
              challenges like frequent network partitions, high communication delays, 
              and the demand for onboard orbit determination
              (OD) and time synchronization present obstacles for these satellite networks. 
              One of the key problems in this context is how
              to schedule satellite communications and generate a contact
              plan. This paper presents an integrative solution that combines
              navigation and communications performance for contact plan
              optimization. Additionally, we propose a novel two-way ISL
              scheme to acquire range and differential clock bias estimates
              that take into account rapid inter-satellite range shifts and light
              time delays. Building on these, a distributed orbit and clock bias
              estimation algorithm is introduced, which emphasizes the use of
              batch processing to improve orbit observability. Performance
              metrics are validated through a simulation of a lunar navigation
              constellation, assessing OD error, time synchronization error,
              and inter-satellite communication delay. The combined insights
              and proposals presented, especially in terms of navigation and
              communications performance tradeoffs, offer promising avenues to enhance
              the operability and efficiency of small satellite
              networks on the Moon.},

  author   = {Iiyama, Keidai and Neamati, Daniel and Gao, Grace},
  abstract = {To address the need for robust positioning, navigation, and timing services in lunar environments, this paper proposes a novel
              fault detection framework for satellite constellations using inter-satellite ranging (ISR). Traditionally, navigation satellites can
              depend on a robust network of ground-based stations for fault monitoring. However, due to cost constraints, a comprehensive
              ground segment on the lunar surface is impractical for lunar constellations. Our approach leverages vertex redundantly rigid
              graphs to detect faults without relying on precise ephemeris. We model satellite constellations as graphs where satellites are
              vertices and inter-satellite links are edges. We identify faults through the singular values of the geometric-centered Euclidean
              distance matrix (GCEDM) of 2-vertex redundantly rigid sub-graphs. The proposed method is validated through simulations
              of constellations around the Moon, demonstrating its effectiveness in various configurations. This research contributes to the
              reliable operation of satellite constellations for future lunar exploration missions.},
