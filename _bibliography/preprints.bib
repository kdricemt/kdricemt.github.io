  abstract = {To address the need for robust positioning, navigation, and timing services in lunar environments, this paper proposes a novel onboard clock phase jump detection framework for satellite constellations using range measurements obtained from dual one-way inter-satellite links. 
              Our approach leverages vertex redundantly rigid graphs to detect faults without relying on prior knowledge of satellite positions or clock biases,
              providing flexibility for lunar satellite networks with diverse satellite types and operators.
              We model satellite constellations as graphs, where satellites are vertices and inter-satellite links are edges. 
              The proposed algorithm detects and identifies satellites with clock jumps by monitoring the singular values of the geometric-centered Euclidean distance matrix (GCEDM) of 5-clique sub-graphs. 
              The proposed method is validated through simulations of a GPS constellation and a notional constellation around the Moon, demonstrating its effectiveness in various configurations. },

  title    = {Trade-off Analysis for Lunar Augmented Navigation Service (LANS) Constellation Design},
  author   = {Iiyama, Keidai and Gao, Grace},
  abstract = {The establishment of a sustainable human presence on the Moon demands robust positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) services capable of supporting both surface and orbital operations. 
              This paper presents a comprehensive trade-off analysis of lunar frozen-orbit constellations for the Lunar Augmented Navigation Service (LANS), focusing on how the number of satellites and orbital parameters influence coverage, position dilution of precision (PDOP), orbit determination accuracy, receiver noise, and orbit insertion cost.
              Three Walker-constellation families based on frozen elliptical and circular orbits are examined to characterize their relative advantages across different semi-major axes and inclinations.
              Results show that larger semi-major axes enhance both polar and global coverage, though the optimal inclination depends on the constellation type and target service region. 
              The south elliptical lunar frozen orbit (ELFO) Walker constellation provides superior performance for polar coverage and PDOP, whereas the circular lunar frozen orbit (CLFO) Walker configuration achieves the best global uniformity. 
              Orbit determination errors and receiver noise both increase with larger semi-major axes and higher inclinations, reflecting weaker geometric observability and reduced received signal power at apolune for eccentric orbits. 
              Orbit insertion analysis reveals clear trade-offs among transfer duration, characteristic energy (C3) at trans-lunar injection, and insertion Delta-V: shorter transfers require higher insertion Delta-V, while low-energy transfers achieve smaller Delta-V at the cost of months-long durations and higher C3.
              These findings provide a systematic framework for designing LANS constellations for both regional and global coverage. },

  title    = {Ionospheric and Plasmaspheric Delay Characterization for Lunar Terrestrial GNSS Receivers with Global Core Plasma Model},
  author   = {Iiyama, Keidai and Gao, Grace},
  abstract = {Recent advancements in lunar positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) have demonstrated that terrestrial GNSS signals, including weak sidelobe transmissions, can be exploited for lunar spacecraft positioning and timing. 
              While GNSS-based navigation at the Moon has been validated recently, unmodeled ionospheric and plasmaspheric delays remain a significant error source, particularly given the unique signal geometry and extended propagation paths.
              This paper characterizes these delays using the Global Core Plasma Model (GCPM) and a custom low-cost ray-tracing algorithm that iteratively solves for bent signal paths.
              We simulate first-, second-, and third-order group delays, as well as excess path length from ray bending, for GNSS signals received at both lunar orbit and the lunar south pole under varying solar and geomagnetic conditions.
              Results show that mean group delays are typically on the order of 1 m, but can exceed 100 m for low-altitude ray paths during high solar activity, while bending delays are generally smaller but non-negligible for low-altitude ray paths.
              We also quantify the influence of signal frequency, geomagnetic $K_p$ index, and solar R12 index.
              These findings inform the design of robust positioning and timing algorithms that utilize terrestrial GNSS signals.},

  title    = {Ephemeris and Almanac Design for Lunar Navigation Satellites},
  author   = {Iiyama, Keidai and Gao, Grace},
  abstract = {This paper presents almanac and ephemeris message representation for lunar navigation satellites supporting the Lunar Augmented Navigation System (LANS). 
              The proposed method combines osculating orbital elements, Chebyshev polynomials, and Fourier series to efficiently represent lunar satellite trajectories subject to complex perturbations from lunar gravity and third-body effects. 
              For the ephemeris, a hybrid Chebyshevâ€“Fourier formulation improves fitting accuracy over long arcs while maintaining message compactness under the datasize constraint of the LunaNet Interoperability Specification. For the almanac, a compact low-order polynomial and Fourier model is introduced to capture mid-term orbital variations over a 15-day fitting arc. 
              The approach is validated for multiple orbit regimes, including 30-hour, 24-hour, and 12-hour elliptical Lunar frozen orbits (ELFOs) and a 6-hour polar orbit. 
              Results show that the proposed framework achieves sub-meter position and sub-millimeter-per-second velocity fitting errors within the 900-bit limit for 6-hour ephemeris arcs, and almanac fitting accuracy sufficient for reliable satellite visibility identification in warm-start operations. },
