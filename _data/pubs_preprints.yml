  abstract: This paper presents almanac and ephemeris message representation for lunar
    navigation satellites supporting the Lunar Augmented Navigation System (LANS).
    The proposed method combines osculating orbital elements, Chebyshev polynomials,
    and Fourier series to efficiently represent lunar satellite trajectories subject
    to complex perturbations from lunar gravity and third-body effects. For the ephemeris,
    a hybrid Chebyshevâ€“Fourier formulation improves fitting accuracy over long arcs
    while maintaining message compactness under the datasize constraint of the LunaNet
    Interoperability Specification. For the almanac, a compact low-order polynomial
    and Fourier model is introduced to capture mid-term orbital variations over a
    15-day fitting arc. The approach is validated for multiple orbit regimes, including
    30-hour, 24-hour, and 12-hour elliptical Lunar frozen orbits (ELFOs) and a 6-hour
    polar orbit. Results show that the proposed framework achieves sub-meter position
    and sub-millimeter-per-second velocity fitting errors within the 900-bit limit
    for 6-hour ephemeris arcs, and almanac fitting accuracy sufficient for reliable
    satellite visibility identification in warm-start operations.

  abstract: Recent advancements in lunar positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT)
    have demonstrated that terrestrial GNSS signals, including weak sidelobe transmissions,
    can be exploited for lunar spacecraft positioning and timing. While GNSS-based
    navigation at the Moon has been validated recently, unmodeled ionospheric and
    plasmaspheric delays remain a significant error source, particularly given the
    unique signal geometry and extended propagation paths. This paper characterizes
    these delays using the Global Core Plasma Model (GCPM) and a custom low-cost ray-tracing
    algorithm that iteratively solves for bent signal paths. We simulate first-, second-,
    and third-order group delays, as well as excess path length from ray bending,
    for GNSS signals received at both lunar orbit and the lunar south pole under varying
    solar and geomagnetic conditions. Results show that mean group delays are typically
    on the order of 1 m, but can exceed 100 m for low-altitude ray paths during high
    solar activity, while bending delays are generally smaller but non-negligible
    for low-altitude ray paths. We also quantify the influence of signal frequency,
    geomagnetic $K_p$ index, and solar R12 index. These findings inform the design
    of robust positioning and timing algorithms that utilize terrestrial GNSS signals.

  abstract: 'The establishment of a sustainable human presence on the Moon demands
    robust positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) services capable of supporting
    both surface and orbital operations. This paper presents a comprehensive trade-off
    analysis of lunar frozen-orbit constellations for the Lunar Augmented Navigation
    Service (LANS), focusing on how the number of satellites and orbital parameters
    influence coverage, position dilution of precision (PDOP), orbit determination
    accuracy, receiver noise, and orbit insertion cost. Three Walker-constellation
    families based on frozen elliptical and circular orbits are examined to characterize
    their relative advantages across different semi-major axes and inclinations. Results
    show that larger semi-major axes enhance both polar and global coverage, though
    the optimal inclination depends on the constellation type and target service region.
    The south elliptical lunar frozen orbit (ELFO) Walker constellation provides superior
    performance for polar coverage and PDOP, whereas the circular lunar frozen orbit
    (CLFO) Walker configuration achieves the best global uniformity. Orbit determination
    errors and receiver noise both increase with larger semi-major axes and higher
    inclinations, reflecting weaker geometric observability and reduced received signal
    power at apolune for eccentric orbits. Orbit insertion analysis reveals clear
    trade-offs among transfer duration, characteristic energy (C3) at trans-lunar
    injection, and insertion Delta-V: shorter transfers require higher insertion Delta-V,
    while low-energy transfers achieve smaller Delta-V at the cost of months-long
    durations and higher C3. These findings provide a systematic framework for designing
    LANS constellations for both regional and global coverage.'

  abstract: To address the need for robust positioning, navigation, and timing services
    in lunar environments, this paper proposes a novel onboard clock phase jump detection
    framework for satellite constellations using range measurements obtained from
    dual one-way inter-satellite links. Our approach leverages vertex redundantly
    rigid graphs to detect faults without relying on prior knowledge of satellite
    positions or clock biases, providing flexibility for lunar satellite networks
    with diverse satellite types and operators. We model satellite constellations
    as graphs, where satellites are vertices and inter-satellite links are edges.
    The proposed algorithm detects and identifies satellites with clock jumps by monitoring
    the singular values of the geometric-centered Euclidean distance matrix (GCEDM)
    of 5-clique sub-graphs. The proposed method is validated through simulations of
    a GPS constellation and a notional constellation around the Moon, demonstrating
    its effectiveness in various configurations.
