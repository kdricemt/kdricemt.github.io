  abstract: To address the need for robust positioning, navigation, and timing services
    in lunar environments, this paper proposes a novel fault detection framework for
    satellite constellations using inter-satellite ranging (ISR). Traditionally, navigation
    satellites can depend on a robust network of ground-based stations for fault monitoring.
    However, due to cost constraints, a comprehensive ground segment on the lunar
    surface is impractical for lunar constellations. Our approach leverages vertex
    redundantly rigid graphs to detect faults without relying on precise ephemeris.
    We model satellite constellations as graphs where satellites are vertices and
    inter-satellite links are edges. We identify faults through the singular values
    of the geometric-centered Euclidean distance matrix (GCEDM) of 2-vertex redundantly
    rigid sub-graphs. The proposed method is validated through simulations of constellations
    around the Moon, demonstrating its effectiveness in various configurations. This
    research contributes to the reliable operation of satellite constellations for
    future lunar exploration missions.

  abstract: Future deep space exploration stands to benefit significantly from networks
    of small satellites, given their cost-effective communication and monitoring capabilities.
    However, challenges like frequent network partitions, high communication delays,
    and the demand for onboard orbit determination (OD) and time synchronization present
    obstacles for these satellite networks. One of the key problems in this context
    is how to schedule satellite communications and generate a contact plan. This
    paper presents an integrative solution that combines navigation and communications
    performance for contact plan optimization. Additionally, we propose a novel two-way
    ISL scheme to acquire range and differential clock bias estimates that take into
    account rapid inter-satellite range shifts and light time delays. Building on
    these, a distributed orbit and clock bias estimation algorithm is introduced,
    which emphasizes the use of batch processing to improve orbit observability. Performance
    metrics are validated through a simulation of a lunar navigation constellation,
    assessing OD error, time synchronization error, and inter-satellite communication
    delay. The combined insights and proposals presented, especially in terms of navigation
    and communications performance tradeoffs, offer promising avenues to enhance the
    operability and efficiency of small satellite networks on the Moon.

  abstract: The growing focus on missions to the Moon necessitates reliable Positioning,
    Navigation, and Timing (PNT) services in cis-lunar space. This paper introduces
    a comprehensive, open-source simulation framework developed to address the growing
    research need in this field. Implemented primarily in C++ for computational efficiency,
    the framework also includes Python bindings to facilitate rapid algorithmic development
    and user interaction. The simulation core employs an event-based architecture
    to model asynchronous onboard applications and inter-satellite communication.
    High-fidelity lunar dynamics modeling, incorporating planetary ephemerides, high-order
    gravitational effects, third-body perturbations, and solar radiation pressure,
    is also integrated. This framework’s modular and extensible architecture allows
    for broad applicability across various research applications, from the performance
    analysis of Lunar Navigation Satellite System (LNSS) constellations to the assessment
    of orbit determination algorithms and lunar navigation payloads. In addition to
    describing the architectural and algorithmic facets of the framework, the paper
    presents use cases demonstrating its efficacy in onboard orbit determination and
    timing. Although the framework is initially targeted at lunar applications, its
    architectural design allows for straightforward adaptation to model PNT systems
    in other celestial domains, including Martian or Earth orbital environments.

  abstract: Relative positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) are crucial to support
    proximity operations of multiple spacecraft in lunar orbit, which is expected
    to play a key role in upcoming lunar missions. We propose a relative positioning
    and timekeeping technique in lunar orbit that leverages differential carrier phase
    measurements of the terrestrial GPS signals. However, using GPS signals in the
    lunar orbit is challenging due to 1) the clustered GPS satellite direction leading
    to a low-observable system, 2) the nonexistence of ionosphere delay models for
    lunar orbit, and 3) the possibility of cycle slips in the low C/N0 signals. We
    designed a PNT framework that tackles the three challenges above. First, to robustly
    make the filter converge in a low-observable system, the proposed PNT framework
    estimates the absolute and relative states in two separate filters, where filter
    settings (e.g., process noise) can be tuned separately. Second, to remove the
    signal-in-space errors, the proposed filter utilizes three different differential
    measurements. The absolute filter estimates time-differenced carrier phase (TDCP)
    measurements in combination with the pseudorange and pseudorange rate measurements,
    avoiding the need for estimating the integer ambiguity terms that are low observable.
    The relative filter estimates the relative orbit and clock offsets by processing
    the single difference carrier phase (SDCP) measurements, where signal-in-space
    errors are removed thanks to the short inter-satellite distance compared to the
    Earth-Moon distance. Using the obtained single difference float ambiguity estimate,
    the relative filter also fixes the integer ambiguities in double difference carrier
    phase (DDCP) measurements to improve the relative orbit estimates. Finally, cycleslip
    corrupted carrier-phase measurements are removed by observing the residuals in
    the TDCP measurements. We demonstrate the filter’s performance through simulations
    of two closely operating lunar satellites with different clock grades in the elliptical
    lunar frozen orbit (ELFO), wherein we showcase higher positioning and timing accuracy
    compared to code phase-only PNT methods.

  abstract: Plans to establish a satellite network around the Moon to support communication,
    position, navigation, and timing services are rapidly evolving. Satellites that
    are part of this system broadcast their ephemeris as finite parameters to lunar
    users for user state estimation. We investigate lunar satellite ephemeris parameterization
    to identify the optimal parameterization to broadcast to a lunar user. The proposed
    framework directly approximates the lunar satellite position and velocity in the
    inertial frame, along with approximating conversion parameters necessary for representation
    in the lunar fixed frame. The framework leverages signal-in-space-error requirements
    as constraints in the approximation process to guide the search for the best parameterization.
    We evaluate the performance of our proposed framework for satellites in a Low
    Lunar Orbit and an Elliptical Lunar Frozen Orbit. The performance of different
    methods is assessed based on the precision of the ephemeris prediction, approximation
    interval, and message size. We showcase the ability of the developed framework
    to approximate satellite ephemeris for both orbits to the desired precision by
    adjusting the approximation period and the number of broadcasted parameters. Particularly,
    we demonstrate that model formulations with a standard polynomial basis and a
    Chebyshev polynomial basis produce feasible solutions for ephemeris approximation
    at varying epochs in orbits, abiding by stringent signal-in-space-error requirements.

  abstract: There is a growing interest in the use of legacy terrestrial Global Positioning
    System (GPS) signals to determine the precise positioning and timing onboard a
    lunar satellite. Unlike prior works that utilize pseudoranges with meter-level
    accuracy, we propose a precise positioning and timekeeping technique that leverages
    carrier-phase measurements with millimeter-level accuracy (when integer ambiguities
    are correctly fixed). We design an extended Kalman filter framework that harnesses
    the intermittently available terrestrial GPS time-differenced carrier-phase (TDCP)
    values and gravitational accelerations predicted by the orbital filter. To estimate
    the process noise covariance, we implement an adaptive state noise compensation
    algorithm that adapts to the challenging lunar environment with weak gravity and
    strong third-body perturbations. Additionally, we perform measurement residual
    analysis to discard TDCP measurements corrupted by cycle slips and increased measurement
    noise. We present Monte-Carlo simulations of a lunar satellite in an elliptical
    lunar frozen orbit and quasi-frozen low lunar orbit, wherein we showcase higher
    positioning and timing accuracy as compared with the pseudorange-only navigation
    solution.

    is to provide the communication, positioning, navigation, and timing (CPNT) service
    at the lunar South Pole region. Our primary lunar user is a pressurized rover
    that will explore the South Pole region and the LNSS has been designed to help
    the rover locate its own position on moon surface satellite images. The LNSS satellites
    will be also utilized as communication link nodes between the earth and the lunar
    surface user. The expected positioning accuracy at the South Pole region by the
    LNSS will be evaluated by our demonstration mission currently scheduled in 2028.
    The LNSS is not only for our lunar users, but also to contribute to the system
    of lunar communication and navigation satellite systems that will be completed
    by the international collaboration for the benefit of all humankind.

  abstract: Reliable lunar communication infrastructure will be instrumental in building
    a sustainable human presence on the Moon. Recently, NASA has awarded a $14.1 million
    contract to Nokia for developing a 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE) network on the
    Moon. In particular, there has been a great emphasis on designing a low-power
    and an ultra-compact LTE solution for the future Lunar Surface Communication Network
    (LSCN) due to its ease of transportation and potential for scalable deployment
    on the lunar surface. Ensuring a reliable LSCN design requires the base stations
    to be time-synchronized, and to maintain a precise globally referenced timing
    standard. We propose an LSCN design with distributed time-transfer from Earth-GPS
    to maintain precise timing across the network. We design a diffusion Kalman filter
    framework that utilizes the intermittently available Earth-GPS signals and the
    crosslink signals exchanged among the LSCN base stations to facilitate global
    time synchronization, while alleviating the timing stability and SWaP requirements
    for the on-site clocks. We validate our proposed technique by simulating the Earth-GPS
    satellites and multiple base stations near the Moon's Haworth Crater using the
    Systems Tool Kit (STK) software. We simulate the visibility and carrier-to-noise-density
    ratio of the Earth-GPS satellites at each LSCN base station, while examining the
    timing accuracy performance when each base station is equipped with a low-SWaP
    Chip Scale Atomic Clock (CSAC). We demonstrate the robustness of our distributed
    time-transfer technique as the error covariance of the transmission delay is varied.

  abstract: 'This paper demonstrates an algorithmic framework for autonomous, distributed
    navigation and timekeeping for spacecraft swarms and constellations using angles-only
    measurements from onboard cameras. Angles-only methods are compelling as they
    reduce reliance on external measurement sources. However, prior flight demonstrations
    have faced limitations, including 1) inability to treat multi-agent space systems
    including multiple observers and targets in an accurate and timely manner, 2)
    lack of autonomy and reliance on external state information, and 3) treatment
    of primarily Earth-orbiting scenarios. The Absolute and Relative Trajectory Measurement
    System (ARTMS) discussed in this paper overcomes these challenges to enable future
    lunar missions. It consists of three novel algorithms: 1) Image Processing, which
    tracks and identifies targets in images and computes their bearing angles; 2)
    Batch Orbit Determination, which computes a swarm state initialization from angles-only
    measurements; and 3) Sequential Orbit Determination, which uses an unscented Kalman
    filter to refine the swarm state, seamlessly fusing measurements from multiple
    observers to achieve the necessary robustness and autonomy. This paper augments
    ARTMS for lunar navigation and its theoretical performance is investigated through
    a quantitative observability analysis. High-fidelity simulations with a star tracker
    in the loop demonstrate successful navigation of swarms and constellations in
    low lunar orbits, near-rectilinear halo orbits, and elliptic frozen orbits. ARTMS
    achieves absolute orbit estimation for all swarm members using only inter-satellite
    angles with simultaneous estimation of differential clock offsets and ballistic
    coefficients. It therefore presents an important capability for the support of
    future lunar and planetary exploration.'

  abstract: The development of a robust navigation infrastructure in cis-lunar space
    is crucial for the coming new era of advanced lunar exploration. NASA has set
    a goal to develop an extensible and scalable lunar communication and navigation
    architecture called LunaNet. For the flexibility and robustness of the system,
    the architecture is desired to have an autonomous and decentralized operation
    capability. This paper presents and demonstrates a decentralized and autonomous
    state estimation algorithm for SmallSats that provides positioning, navigation,
    and timing service, each equipped with a GNSS receiver, chip-scale atomic clock,
    and inter-satellite communication module. In the framework, each satellite individually
    estimates its own state and clock offset with a decentralized Schmidt Extended
    Kalman Filter by processing weak GNSS signal and inter-satellite range measurements.
    The algorithm is validated with Monte-Carlo state estimate simulations of five
    satellites at the hybrid constellation of lunar frozen orbit and the Near-Rectilinear
    Halo Orbit (NRHO). The proposed filter converged in all Monte-Carlo cases with
    clock offset errors below 0.15 microseconds and 1.0 microseconds in the frozen
    orbit and the NRHO, respectively.

  abstract: This paper presents an application of a computer vision technique called
    Semantic Segmentation to a Hazard Detection (HD) algorithm for planetary landing.
    Three convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures are trained with binary
    (safe or unsafe) safety maps and multi-hazard-class safety maps. Their performance
    is compared together with a replicated state-of-the-art (SOA) HD algorithm from
    NASA's Autonomous Landing Hazard Avoidance Technology (ALHAT) project. To train
    and test each method, we prepared a dataset that is rich enough to reproduce the
    fine hazardous features by developing a realistic Digital Elevation Map (DEM)
    generator. Our DEM generator produces realistic terrains in arbitrary high resolution
    and the safeness of each pixel of DEMs is examined by computing the maximum possible
    slope and roughness for a given lander geometry and landing attitude. The results
    show that all three CNN architectures perform better than the replicated SOA HD
    algorithm for noised DEMs. The networks trained with multi-hazard-class safety
    maps result in better accuracy in terms of mean intersection over union (mIoU)
    but do not improve pixel accuracy.

  abstract: This research proposes a new integrated framework for identifying safe
    landing locations and planning in-flight divert maneuvers. The state-of-the-art
    algorithms for landing zone selection utilize local terrain features such as slopes
    and roughness to judge the safety and priority of the landing point. However,
    when there are additional chances of observation and diverting in the future,
    these algorithms are not able to evaluate the safety of the decision itself to
    target the selected landing point considering the overall descent trajectory.
    In response to this challenge, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that
    optimizes a landing site selection strategy concurrently with a guidance and control
    strategy to the target landing site. The trained agent could evaluate and select
    landing sites with explicit consideration of the terrain features, quality of
    future observations, and control to achieve a safe and efficient landing trajectory
    at a system-level. The proposed framework was able to achieve 94.8 % of successful
    landing in highly challenging landing sites where over 80% of the area around
    the initial target lading point is hazardous, by effectively updating the target
    landing site and feedback control gain during descent.

  abstract: EQUULEUS is a 6U CubeSat developed by the University of Tokyo and JAXA,
    which will fly to a libration orbit around the second Earth-Moon Lagrange point
    (EML2) as a secondary payload of the Space Launch System (SLS). At the destination
    and on the way there, EQUULEUS will conduct three scientific missions such as
    the detection of lunar impact flashes. To realize these missions, the thermal
    design of EQUULEUS faces constraints coupled with other subsystems. The Engineering
    Model (EM) was designed to clear these constraints, but after verification by
    a thermal vacuum test, one mission component did not meet the temperature requirements.
    To clear the problems in the EM, changes in operation strategies, temperature
    range management, and thermal interface materials were made. These design changes
    were verified by another thermal vacuum test, and we proved that EQUULEUS can
    meet the constraints to reach EML2 and conduct its scientific missions.

  abstract: EQUULEUS, a 6U CubeSat co-developed by the University of Tokyo and JAXA,
    will fly to a libration orbit around the second Earth-Moon Lagrange point (EML2),
    and conduct scientific observations such as detection of the lunar impact flashes.
    To realize these observations, thermal design of EQUULEUS faces three constraints
    coupled with the design of other subsystems. Firstly, because there is an uncertainty
    of the launch date, EQUULEUS will have to consider the variation of the sun direction
    at thrusting phases, which changes the heater wattage to achieve the required
    thrust value. Secondly, at the observation phase around EML2, EQUULEUS will also
    experience the sunlight from various direction. Lastly, the water resistojet propulsion
    system adopted for trajectory control and angular momentum unloading of EQUULEUS
    makes the thermal design more difficult in terms of freezing and the latent heat
    for vaporization. Under the constraints, we proposed the thermal design of EQUULEUS
    Engineering Model (EM), validated the design by numerical simulations and the
    thermal vacuum test.

  abstract: The Lunar Global Navigation Satellite System (LGNSS) could significantly
    improve lunar missions' operational capability and flexibility by providing real-time,
    continuous, and highly accurate positioning services to lunar users. To achieve
    accurate user positioning, the orbit and clock bias of the navigation satellites
    have to be estimated accurately. An effective way to accurately estimate the orbit
    of navigation satellites in the lunar fixed frame is to process the psudorange
    data generated from the received navigation signals at lunar monitoring stations
    (LMSs) on the lunar surface. This paper presents a method to simulate the orbit
    determination error of the navigation satellites and the positioning error of
    the lunar user, assuming the usage of LMSs. We also propose a method to optimize
    the satellite constellation and LMS configuration to minimize the user positioning
    error. When optimizing, we reduced the number of design parameters by assuming
    the geometric symmetry of the navigation satellite constellation and LMS arrangement.
    Considering the sensitivity of the LMS arrangement and satellite constellation
    on the user positioning error, step by step optimization method is proposed. In
    the proposed method, the candidate constellation is first narrowed down by satellite
    visibility and PDOP analysis, followed by the LMS arrangement optimization for
    the selected constellations. Finally, the user positioning accuracy performance
    of the optimized configuration for 20 navigation satellites and 8 LMSs is analyzed.
    The results showed that the obtained constellation could achieve positioning errors
    below 10m in 3$\sigma$ for the global average.
