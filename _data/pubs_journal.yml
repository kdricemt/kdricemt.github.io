  abstract: Recent advancements in lunar positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT)
    have demonstrated that terrestrial GNSS signals, including weak sidelobe transmissions,
    can be exploited for lunar spacecraft positioning and timing. While GNSS-based
    navigation at the Moon has been validated recently, unmodeled ionospheric and
    plasmaspheric delays remain a significant error source, particularly given the
    unique signal geometry and extended propagation paths. This paper characterizes
    these delays using the Global Core Plasma Model (GCPM) and a custom low-cost ray-tracing
    algorithm that iteratively solves for bent signal paths. We simulate first-, second-,
    and third-order group delays, as well as excess path length from ray bending,
    for GNSS signals received at both lunar orbit and the lunar south pole under varying
    solar and geomagnetic conditions. Results show that mean group delays are typically
    on the order of 1 m, but can exceed 100 m for low-altitude ray paths during high
    solar activity, while bending delays are generally smaller but non-negligible
    for low-altitude ray paths. We also quantify the influence of signal frequency,
    geomagnetic $K_p$ index, and solar R12 index. These findings inform the design
    of robust positioning and timing algorithms that utilize terrestrial GNSS signals.

  abstract: 'The establishment of a sustainable human presence on the Moon demands
    robust positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) services capable of supporting
    both surface and orbital operations. This paper presents a comprehensive trade-off
    analysis of lunar frozen-orbit constellations for the Lunar Augmented Navigation
    Service (LANS), focusing on how the number of satellites and orbital parameters
    influence coverage, position dilution of precision (PDOP), orbit determination
    accuracy, receiver noise, and orbit insertion cost. Three Walker-constellation
    families based on frozen elliptical and circular orbits are examined to characterize
    their relative advantages across different semi-major axes and inclinations. Results
    show that larger semi-major axes enhance both polar and global coverage, though
    the optimal inclination depends on the constellation type and target service region.
    The south elliptical lunar frozen orbit (ELFO) Walker constellation provides superior
    performance for polar coverage and PDOP, whereas the circular lunar frozen orbit
    (CLFO) Walker configuration achieves the best global uniformity. Orbit determination
    errors and receiver noise both increase with larger semi-major axes and higher
    inclinations, reflecting weaker geometric observability and reduced received signal
    power at apolune for eccentric orbits. Orbit insertion analysis reveals clear
    trade-offs among transfer duration, characteristic energy (C3) at trans-lunar
    injection, and insertion Delta-V: shorter transfers require higher insertion Delta-V,
    while low-energy transfers achieve smaller Delta-V at the cost of months-long
    durations and higher C3. These findings provide a systematic framework for designing
    LANS constellations for both regional and global coverage.'

  abstract: To address the need for robust positioning, navigation, and timing services
    in lunar environments, this paper proposes a novel onboard clock phase jump detection
    framework for satellite constellations using range measurements obtained from
    dual one-way inter-satellite links. Our approach leverages vertex redundantly
    rigid graphs to detect faults without relying on prior knowledge of satellite
    positions or clock biases, providing flexibility for lunar satellite networks
    with diverse satellite types and operators. We model satellite constellations
    as graphs, where satellites are vertices and inter-satellite links are edges.
    The proposed algorithm detects and identifies satellites with clock jumps by monitoring
    the singular values of the geometric-centered Euclidean distance matrix (GCEDM)
    of 5-clique sub-graphs. The proposed method is validated through simulations of
    a GPS constellation and a notional constellation around the Moon, demonstrating
    its effectiveness in various configurations.

  title: Satellite Ephemeris Parameterization Methods to Support Lunar Positioning,

  abstract: Plans to establish a satellite network around the Moon to support communication,
    position, navigation, and timing services are rapidly evolving. Satellites that
    are part of this system broadcast their ephemeris as finite parameters to lunar
    users for user state estimation. In this work, we investigate lunar satellite
    ephemeris design to identify the optimal parameterization to broadcast to a lunar
    user. The proposed framework directly approximates the lunar satellite position
    and velocity in the inertial frame and obtains the conversion parameters necessary
    for state representation in the lunar fixed frame. The framework leverages signal-in-space-error
    requirements as constraints in the parameterization process to guide the search
    for the best ephemeris parameter set. We evaluate the performance of our proposed
    framework for satellites in a low lunar orbit and an elliptical lunar frozen orbit.
    The performance of different methods is assessed based on the precision of the
    ephemeris prediction, fit interval, and message size. We showcase the ability
    of the developed framework to approximate satellite ephemeris for both orbits
    to the desired precision by adjusting the fit interval and the number of parameters
    to broadcast. In particular, we demonstrate that formulations with a standard
    polynomial basis and a Chebyshev polynomial basis produce feasible solutions for
    ephemeris approximation at varying epochs in orbits, abiding by signal-in-space-error
    requirements.

  abstract: There is a growing interest in the use of legacy terrestrial Global Positioning
    System (GPS) signals to determine the precise positioning and timing onboard a
    lunar satellite. Unlike prior works that utilize pseudoranges with meter-level
    accuracy, we propose a precise positioning and timekeeping technique that leverages
    carrier-phase measurements with millimeter-level accuracy (when integer ambiguities
    are correctly fixed). We design an extended Kalman filter framework that harnesses
    the intermittently available terrestrial GPS time-differenced carrier-phase (TDCP)
    values and gravitational accelerations predicted by the orbital filter. To estimate
    the process noise covariance, we implement an adaptive state noise compensation
    algorithm that adapts to the challenging lunar environment with weak gravity and
    strong third-body perturbations. Additionally, we perform measurement residual
    analysis to discard TDCP measurements corrupted by cycle slips and increased measurement
    noise. We present Monte-Carlo simulations of a lunar satellite in an elliptical
    lunar frozen orbit and quasi-frozen low lunar orbit, wherein we showcase higher
    positioning and timing accuracy as compared with the pseudorange-only navigation
    solution.

  abstract: 'EQUULEUS (EQUilibriUm Lunar-Earth point 6U Spacecraft) will be the world''s
    smallest spacecraft to explore the Earth–Moon Lagrange point. It is being jointly
    developed by JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) and the University of Tokyo,
    and will be launched by NASA''s Space Launch System Exploration Mission-1. The
    spacecraft will fly to a libration orbit around the Earth–Moon L2 point (EML2)
    and will demonstrate low-energy trajectory-control techniques within the Sun—Earth—Moon
    region for the first time by a nano-class spacecraft. EQUULEUS also carries three
    scientific observation missions: imaging of Earth''s plasmasphere by extreme ultraviolet
    wavelength, lunar impact flash observation on the far side of the moon, and micrometeoroid
    flux measurements in the cis-lunar region. While all these missions have their
    own scientific objectives, they will also contribute to future human activity
    and/or infrastructure development in the cis-lunar region. Most parts of the spacecraft
    system use commercial off-the-shelf components, or are designed based on the experiences
    of various past space missions, with the exception of the newly developed water
    resistojet propulsion system. EQUULEUS uses X-band frequency for deep space telecommunication.
    Japanese deep space antennas (64-m and 34-m) will be nominally used for spacecraft
    operation, and support from the deep space network of JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory)
    is also being planned, especially for the initial phase of operation. The spacecraft
    will fly to EML2 in less than one year, and will remain there for scientific observations
    until shortly before the depletion of the onboard propellant, when the spacecraft
    will leave the orbit for space-debris compliance.'
