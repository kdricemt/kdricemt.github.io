  abstract: To address the need for robust positioning, navigation, and timing services
    in lunar environments, this paper proposes a novel fault detection framework for
    satellite constellations using inter-satellite ranging (ISR). Traditionally, navigation
    satellites can depend on a robust network of ground-based stations for fault monitoring.
    However, due to cost constraints, a comprehensive ground segment on the lunar
    surface is impractical for lunar constellations. Our approach leverages vertex
    redundantly rigid graphs to detect faults without relying on precise ephemeris.
    We model satellite constellations as graphs where satellites are vertices and
    inter-satellite links are edges. We identify faults through the singular values
    of the geometric-centered Euclidean distance matrix (GCEDM) of 2-vertex redundantly
    rigid sub-graphs. The proposed method is validated through simulations of constellations
    around the Moon, demonstrating its effectiveness in various configurations. This
    research contributes to the reliable operation of satellite constellations for
    future lunar exploration missions.

  title: Satellite Ephemeris Parameterization Methods to Support Lunar Positioning,

  abstract: Plans to establish a satellite network around the Moon to support communication,
    position, navigation, and timing services are rapidly evolving. Satellites that
    are part of this system broadcast their ephemeris as finite parameters to lunar
    users for user state estimation. In this work, we investigate lunar satellite
    ephemeris design to identify the optimal parameterization to broadcast to a lunar
    user. The proposed framework directly approximates the lunar satellite position
    and velocity in the inertial frame and obtains the conversion parameters necessary
    for state representation in the lunar fixed frame. The framework leverages signal-in-space-error
    requirements as constraints in the parameterization process to guide the search
    for the best ephemeris parameter set. We evaluate the performance of our proposed
    framework for satellites in a low lunar orbit and an elliptical lunar frozen orbit.
    The performance of different methods is assessed based on the precision of the
    ephemeris prediction, fit interval, and message size. We showcase the ability
    of the developed framework to approximate satellite ephemeris for both orbits
    to the desired precision by adjusting the fit interval and the number of parameters
    to broadcast. In particular, we demonstrate that formulations with a standard
    polynomial basis and a Chebyshev polynomial basis produce feasible solutions for
    ephemeris approximation at varying epochs in orbits, abiding by signal-in-space-error
    requirements.

  title: Precise Positioning and Timekeeping in a Lunar Orbit via Terrestrial GPS

  abstract: There is a growing interest in the use of legacy terrestrial Global Positioning
    System (GPS) signals to determine the precise positioning and timing onboard a
    lunar satellite. Unlike prior works that utilize pseudoranges with meter-level
    accuracy, we propose a precise positioning and timekeeping technique that leverages
    carrier-phase measurements with millimeter-level accuracy (when integer ambiguities
    are correctly fixed). We design an extended Kalman filter framework that harnesses
    the intermittently available terrestrial GPS time-differenced carrier-phase (TDCP)
    values and gravitational accelerations predicted by the orbital filter. To estimate
    the process noise covariance, we implement an adaptive state noise compensation
    algorithm that adapts to the challenging lunar environment with weak gravity and
    strong third-body perturbations. Additionally, we perform measurement residual
    analysis to discard TDCP measurements corrupted by cycle slips and increased measurement
    noise. We present Monte-Carlo simulations of a lunar satellite in an elliptical
    lunar frozen orbit and quasi-frozen low lunar orbit, wherein we showcase higher
    positioning and timing accuracy as compared with the pseudorange-only navigation
    solution.

  abstract: 'EQUULEUS (EQUilibriUm Lunar-Earth point 6U Spacecraft) will be the world''s
    smallest spacecraft to explore the Earth–Moon Lagrange point. It is being jointly
    developed by JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) and the University of Tokyo,
    and will be launched by NASA''s Space Launch System Exploration Mission-1. The
    spacecraft will fly to a libration orbit around the Earth–Moon L2 point (EML2)
    and will demonstrate low-energy trajectory-control techniques within the Sun—Earth—Moon
    region for the first time by a nano-class spacecraft. EQUULEUS also carries three
    scientific observation missions: imaging of Earth''s plasmasphere by extreme ultraviolet
    wavelength, lunar impact flash observation on the far side of the moon, and micrometeoroid
    flux measurements in the cis-lunar region. While all these missions have their
    own scientific objectives, they will also contribute to future human activity
    and/or infrastructure development in the cis-lunar region. Most parts of the spacecraft
    system use commercial off-the-shelf components, or are designed based on the experiences
    of various past space missions, with the exception of the newly developed water
    resistojet propulsion system. EQUULEUS uses X-band frequency for deep space telecommunication.
    Japanese deep space antennas (64-m and 34-m) will be nominally used for spacecraft
    operation, and support from the deep space network of JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory)
    is also being planned, especially for the initial phase of operation. The spacecraft
    will fly to EML2 in less than one year, and will remain there for scientific observations
    until shortly before the depletion of the onboard propellant, when the spacecraft
    will leave the orbit for space-debris compliance.'
