    excerpt: '**Period:** 2019/4-Present  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **Advisor:** Prof.Funase (UTokyo) <br> <br>
    **Abstract:** The Lunar Navigation Satellite System (LNSS) could significantly improve the operational capability and flexibility of future lunar missions by providing real-time, continuous, and highly accurate positioning services to lunar users. I am studying the system configuration optimization, development strategy optimization, and autonomous operation strategies of LNSS.'

    excerpt: '**Period:** 2020/1-Present  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **Advisor:** Prof.Ho (Georgia Tech) <br> <br>
    **Abstract:** This research proposes a new integrated framework for identifying safe landing locations and planning in-flight divert maneuvers. I build a reinforcement learning framework that optimizes a landing site selection strategy concurrently with a guidance and control strategy to the target landing site to achieve a safe and efficient landing trajectory at a system-level.'
