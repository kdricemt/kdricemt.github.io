    **With:** Guillem Casadesus Vila, Prof.Gao (Stanford University) <br><br> 
    
    Space agencies are seeking to utilize delay torelant satellite networks that provides both communication and navigation service to support future deep space missions. We propose an integrative solution that optimizes contact plan of these networks, considering both navigation and communication performance. Additionally, we propose a distributed orbit and clock bias estimation algorithm using covariance intersection. <br><br>

    **With** Guillem Casadesus Vila, Prof.Gao (Stanford University) <br><br>
    
    The growing focus on missions to the Moon necessitates reliable Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) services in cis-lunar space. We are developing a comprehensive, open-source simulation framework to address the growing research need in this field. Implemented primarily in C++ for computational efficiency, the simulation core employs an event-based architecture to model asynchronous onboard applications and inter-satellite communication. The framework also includes Python bindings to facilitate rapid algorithmic development and user interaction. <br><br>

    **With** Sriramya Bhamidipati, Tara Mina, Prof.Gao (Stanford University) <br><br>
    
    We develop various algorithms to conduct orbit determination and time-transfer in the lunar orbit and on lunar surface, that utilize the weak GPS sidelobe signals. We consider both single-agent and multi-agent scenarios at lunar surface and lunar orbit. Our proposed framework uses differential carrier phase measurements and/or crosslinks between lunar satellites to improve PNT performance under challenging GPS geometry. "

    excerpt: "**Period:** 2023/1-Present <br>
    **With:** Marta Cortinovis, Prof.Gao (Stanford) <br> <br>
    
    Plans to establish a satellite network around the Moon to support communication, position, navigation, and timing services are rapidly evolving. Satellites that are part of this system broadcast their ephemeris as finite parameters to lunar users for user state estimation. In this work, We investigate lunar satellite ephemeris parameterization to identify the optimal parameterization to broadcast to a lunar user.

    **Abstract:** We developed The Absolute and Relative Trajectory Measurement System (ARTMS), an algorithmic framework for autonomous, distributed navigation and timekeeping for spacecraft swarms and constellations using angles-only measurements from onboard cameras. I worked on augmenting ARTMS for lunar navigation, and verified its performance via a star tracker in the loop simulations of swarms and constellations in various lunar orbits. <br>
    The performance of ARTMS will be tested in LEO in the [NASA's Starling Mission](https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/nasas-starling-mission-sending-swarm-of-satellites-into-orbit/). <br><br>

    **Abstract:** ARLISS is a cansat competition in Black Rock, Nevada. Cansats developed by the participants are launched by rockets, going up high to 4km. In the "comeback competition", the participating teams integrate an autonomous system (including cases, parachutes, and rovers) to direct the CanSat to a designated location. Our team won the overall winner and best accuracy award (0 m), which is given to the team that successfully controlled the rover closest to the designated target.

    **With:** Muhammad Fadhil Ginting (Stanford University) <br><br>
    **Abstract:** We proposed a method for multi-robot mapping and coverage on 2D occupancy grids using high-level semantic information. We represented the distribution of semantic information on occupancy grid map with Dirichlet distribution. Using the semantic distribution, we performed information consensus among robots to build a globally consistent map. Then using the entropy of the semantic information, we develop multi-robot coverage planning algorithm to explore and map the environment efficiently. <br>

    excerpt: "**Class** AA222: Engineering Design Optimization (taught by Prof.Kochenderfer) <br><br>
    **Abstract:** In this work, we propose a factor-graph-based approach to perform batch orbit determination (BOD)using bearing angle measurements from multiple observers. Factor graphs have advantages over the filtering approach in 1) capability to apply sparse optimization algorithms to solve large-scale problems, 2) flexibility to accommodate asynchronous measurements, and 3) improved robustness to highly non-linear systems. We investogate the performance of the proposed factor-graph-based BOD via simulations on low earth orbits, sun-synchronous orbits, and highly elliptical orbits. <br>
