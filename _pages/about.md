I am a master student at The University of Tokyo / Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics. My research interest includes:
- solving complex spacecraft guidance, navigation, and control (GN&C) problems with reinforcement learning
- navigation in cis-lunar space
- space system development and operation under uncertainties
- spacecraft trajectory design

Besides my research, I am also working on thermal design and on-board software development for the EQUULEUS project, which is a 6-U cubesat for cis-lunar region exploration.
