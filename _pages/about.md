I am a  Ph.D. candidate at [Stanford Aero/Astro](https://aa.stanford.edu/) pursuing a Ph.D. in Aeronautics and Astronautics under the supervision of [Professor Gao](https://profiles.stanford.edu/gracegao) in the [Navigation and Autonomous Vehicles (NAV) Lab](https://navlab.stanford.edu/).

As lunar and deep space exploration by small satellites is expected to rapidly increase its scale in the future, a major problem that arises is how to secure the means of navigation with limited ground station resources. My main research interests are in designing positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) algorithms for distributed space systems of satellites and rovers in the lunar region to support future lunar exploration. Currently, I am leading the [Lunar PNT subgroup](https://navlab.stanford.edu/research/LunarPNT) in the NAV Lab and mentoring several students.

Prior to Stanford, I received my B.E. and M.E. degree from the [Aero/Astro Department](http://www.aerospace.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/english/) of [The University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index.html). At the Intelligent Space Systems Laboratory in UTokyo, I worked on the thermal design and on-board software development for EQUULEUS, a 6-U CubeSat targeting the EML2 Halo Orbit as one of the secondary payload of SLS1. Besides the development of EQUULEUS, I researched satellite configurations and autonomous operation strategies for Lunar Navigation Satellite System (LNSS) under the supervision of Prof.Funase.

I also had the honor to collaborate with [Space Systems Optimization Group (SSOG)](https://ssog.ae.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech and [Space Rendezvous Lab (SLAB)](https://damicos.people.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University. At SSOG, I worked on developing deep reinforcement learning algorithms for landing site selection. At SLAB, I worked on multi-agent vision-based angles-only navigation in lunar orbit.

Please refer to my [CV](/files/Keidai_Iiyama_CV.pdf) (last updated at October 2023) for the latest information.
