I am a Ph.D. student at the [Aero/Astro Department](http://www.aerospace.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/english/) of [The University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index.html). I am also an incoming Ph.D. student at [Stanford Aero/Astro](https://aa.stanford.edu/) from September. My research interest includes, but is not limited to:
- Autonomous guidance, navigation, control, and decision-making of spacecraft.
- Spacecraft swarms and distributed space systems.
- Navigation at the lunar surface and cis-lunar space.
- Spacecraft trajectory design and optimization.
- Small satellite system design.


Besides my research, I am also working on thermal design and on-board software development for the EQUULEUS project, which is a 6-U CubeSat for cis-lunar region exploration.

Please refer to my [CV](/files/iiyama_keidai-CV.pdf) for further and latest information.
