Profile
======
I am a master student at The University of Tokyo / Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics. My research interest includes
application of reinforcement learning to spacecraft guidance, navigation, and control (GN&C), space system design considering uncertainties, and spacecraft trajectory design. I am also working as a thermal design and software development engineer for the EQUULEUS project, which is a 6-U cubesat for cis-lunar region exploration.
