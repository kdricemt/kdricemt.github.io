## About Me
I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Aeronautics and Astronautics at Stanford University](https://aa.stanford.edu/), working in the [Navigation and Autonomous Vehicles (NAV) Lab](https://navlab.stanford.edu/) under the supervision of [Professor Grace Gao](https://profiles.stanford.edu/gracegao). 
**I will be on the academic job market this year.** 

Please see my [CV](/files/Keidai_Iiyama_CV.pdf) (last updated at Sep 2025) for additional details and recent publications.

## Research Directions
My research develops positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) algorithms for a "Lunar GPS”—a satellite navigation system to support the next generation of lunar exploration. We are entering a transformative era of space exploration in which NASA and international partners are building LunaNet, an interoperable lunar network that will deliver PNT and communication services across the Moon.

Designing "Lunar GPS" presents unique technical challenges. Lunar navigation satellites must achieve precise orbit determination and time synchronization (ODTS) despite limited ground infrastructure and tight size, weight, and power (SWaP) constraints. Signal structures and ephemeris parameterizations suitable for lunar orbits remain undefined, and the system must ensure interoperability and integrity among multiple service providers with minimal ground monitoring.

My dissertation addresses these challenges through four main thrusts:
1.	**Orbit Determination and Time Synchronization (ODTS)** - 
   I develop filtering algorithms to estimate lunar navigation satellite orbits and clock offsets using weak terrestrial GNSS signals that spill into cislunar space. These methods exploit time-differential carrier-phase (TDCP) measurements and advanced ionospheric/plasmaspheric delay mitigation to overcome poor geometry and low signal power.
    - [Precise Positioning and Timekeeping in a Lunar Orbit via Terrestrial GPS Time-Differenced Carrier-Phase Measurements](https://navi.ion.org/content/71/1/navi.635)", NAVIGATION, 2024
    - [Ionospheric and Plasmaspheric Delay Characterization and Mitigation Methodologies
    for Lunar Terrestrial GNSS Receivers](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kZ8QYdBuAnxXQa_4BczMk-WkM46SVR_8/view), ION GNSS+, 2025, Best Presentation of the Session
2.	**Ephemeris Design for Lunar Satellites** - 
   I propose compact, high-accuracy ephemeris parameterizations capable of fitting elliptical lunar orbits while meeting LunaNet message size and accuracy requirements.
    - [Satellite Ephemeris Parameterization Methods to Support Lunar Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Services](https://navi.ion.org/content/71/4/navi.664), NAVIGATION, 2024  (Best Presentation of the Session at ION GNSS+ 2023)
3.	**Constellation and Deployment Optimization** - 
   I created a staged-deployment optimization framework that co-designs hybrid Walker constellations and launch schedules. The framework expands coverage from south-pole to global service while accounting for positioning accuracy, satellite lifetime, and robustness to failures.
    - [Constellation Design and Staged Development for the Lunar Navigation Satellite System](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14dKsXmlO7jR0pz3i6h72kJFxZAkjdSG_/view), ION GNSS+, 2025
4.	**Integrity Monitoring and Fault Detection** - 
   I designed a satellite clock fault detection and exclusion algorithm that uses inter-satellite ranging. Using graph-rigidity theory, the algorithm identifies and isolates faults without relying on prior ephemeris information or surface monitoring.
   - [Satellite Autonomous Clock Fault Monitoring with Inter-Satellite Ranges Using Euclidean Distance Matrices](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H44Ak13bVx1UWSENy9ofMA3pmXABL1Zh/view), Under review at NAVIGATION  (Best Presentation of the Session at ION GNSS+ 2024)

My work has received multiple awards at ION GNSS+, the world’s largest GNSS conference, and has been cited by researchers at NASA, ESA, and JAXA, contributing directly to the ongoing realization of LunaNet.

Before and during my Ph.D., I worked with several leading space research groups on projects related to lunar and Martian exploration:
- University of Tokyo – 
  I earned B.E. and M.E. in Aerospace Engineering.
  At [Intelligent Space Systems Laboratory (ISSL)](https://www.space.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ehome), I contributed to thermal design and on-board software for EQUULEUS, a 6-U lunar CubeSat that [successfully completed a lunar flyby in 2022](https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/smallsat/2023/all2023/52/).
  I also researched satellite configurations and autonomous operation strategies for a Lunar Navigation Satellite System (LNSS), pioneering work that helped enable a [JAXA–ArkEdge Space lunar navigation development contract](https://insidegnss.com/arkedge-space-selected-by-jaxa-to-lead-lunar-navigation-system-development/).
- Georgia Tech [Space Systems Optimization Group (SSOG)](https://ssog.ae.gatech.edu/)  -
  In collboration with SSOG, I developed deep reinforcement learning algorithms for autonomous lunar landing site selection and guidance (Paper: [AAS/AIAA ASC 20](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12432)). 
- Stanford [Space Rendezvous Lab (SLAB)](https://damicos.people.stanford.edu/) -
  Investigated multi-agent, vision-based angles-only navigation in lunar orbit for potential extensions of NASA’s Starling mission (Paper: [ION ITM 22](https://slab.sites.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj25201/files/media/file/ion_itm_lunar_navigation_paper_rev3.pdf)).
- [NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/) (Section 332H) - 
  Worked on constellation design and orbit determination simulations for next-generation Mars navigation and communication relay networks (Paper: [IEEE AeroConf 25](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11068793)).
