I am a  Ph.D. candidate at [Stanford Aero/Astro](https://aa.stanford.edu/) pursuing a Ph.D. in Aeronautics and Astronautics in the [Navigation and Autonomous Vehicles (NAV) Lab](https://navlab.stanford.edu/). My adviser is [Professor Gao](https://profiles.stanford.edu/gracegao).

My main research interests are in designing positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) algorithms for lunar satellites and rovers to enable "Lunar GPS", and support future lunar exploration. Currently, I am leading the [Lunar PNT subgroup](https://navlab.stanford.edu/research/LunarPNT) in the NAV Lab and mentoring several students.

Prior to Stanford, I received my B.E. and M.E. degree from the [Aero/Astro Department](http://www.aerospace.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/english/) of [The University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index.html), where I worked on the thermal design and on-board software development for EQUULEUS, a 6-U lunar cubesat which succesfully completed a lunar flyby in 2022. Besides the development of EQUULEUS, I researched satellite configurations and autonomous operation strategies for Lunar Navigation Satellite System (LNSS).

In the past, I also had the honor to collaborate with [Space Systems Optimization Group (SSOG)](https://ssog.ae.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech, [Space Rendezvous Lab (SLAB)](https://damicos.people.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University, and Section 332H at [Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/). At SSOG, I worked on developing deep reinforcement learning algorithms for landing site selection. At SLAB, I worked on multi-agent vision-based angles-only navigation in lunar orbit. At JPL, I worked on the constellation design and orbit determination simulation for future Mars navigation + communication constellation to support future human missions on Mars.

Please refer to my [CV](/files/Keidai_Iiyama_CV.pdf) (last updated at September 2024) for the latest information.
