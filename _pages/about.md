Profile
======
I am a master student at The University of Tokyo / Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics. My research interest includes applying reinforcement learning algorithm to solve complex spacecraft guidance, navigation, and control (GN&C) problems, space system design and optimization under uncertainties, and spacecraft trajectory design. Besides my research, I am also working on thermal design and on-board software development for the EQUULEUS project, which is a 6-U cubesat for cis-lunar region exploration.
