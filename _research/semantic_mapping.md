We proposed a method for multi-robot mapping and coverage on 2D occupancy grids using high-level semantic information. We represented the distribution of semantic information on occupancy grid map with Dirichlet distribution. Using the semantic distribution, we performed information consensus among robots to build a globally consistent map. Then using the entropy of the semantic information, we develop multi-robot coverage planning algorithm to explore and map the environment efficiently.
