ARLISS is a cansat competition in Black Rock, Nevada. Cansats developed by the participants are launched by rockets, going up high to 4km. In the "comeback competition", the participating teams integrate an autonomous system (including cases, parachutes, and rovers) to direct the CanSat to a designated location. Our team won the overall winner and best accuracy award (0 m), which is given to the team that successfully controlled the rover closest to the designated target.
