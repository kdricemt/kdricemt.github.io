The growing focus on missions to the Moon necessitates reliable Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) services in cis-lunar space. We are developing a comprehensive, open-source simulation framework to address the growing research need in this field. Implemented primarily in C++ for computational efficiency, the simulation core employs an event-based architecture to model asynchronous onboard applications and inter-satellite communication. The framework also includes Python bindings to facilitate rapid algorithmic development and user interaction. 

The simulator is under active development, is available
