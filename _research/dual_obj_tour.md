The 2022 edition of the <a href='https://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/projects/gecco-2022-competition/'>Space Optimisation Competition (SpOC)</a> organized by the Advanced Concepts Team included a problem involving a âˆ†V and time of flight optimization of a moon tour visiting the seven planets of the Trappist-1 star system. We participated in this competition (5th place), and developed metrics to analyze effictive planets to flyby, as well as heuristics to solve the multiobjective trajectory optimization problem. <br><br>
