Space agencies are seeking to utilize delay torelant satellite networks that provides both communication and navigation service to support future deep space missions. We propose an integrative solution that optimizes contact plan of these networks, considering both navigation and communication performance. Additionally, we propose a distributed orbit and clock bias estimation algorithm using batch covariance intersection. <br><br>
