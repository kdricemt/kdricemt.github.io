| *Concept of the Research* |

Conventional positioning method on lunar surface mainly relies on captured images from lunar orbiters and lacks real-time property. For advanced missions on the lunar surface in the future, it is necessary to achieve high user positioning accuracy and real time property simultaneously. A Lunar Navigation Satellite System (LNSS) is an effective solution to this problem. This study aims to optimize the arrangement and staged development strategy of positioning satellites for LNSS.
