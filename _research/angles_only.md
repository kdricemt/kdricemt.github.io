We developed The Absolute and Relative Trajectory Measurement System (ARTMS), an algorithmic framework for autonomous, distributed navigation and timekeeping for spacecraft swarms and constellations using angles-only measurements from onboard cameras. I worked on augmenting ARTMS for lunar navigation, and verified its performance via a star tracker in the loop simulations of swarms and constellations in various lunar orbits. <br>
The performance of ARTMS will be tested in LEO in the [NASA's Starling Mission](https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/nasas-starling-mission-sending-swarm-of-satellites-into-orbit/). <br><br>
