In this work, we propose a factor-graph-based approach to perform batch orbit determination (BOD) using bearing angle measurements from multiple observers. Factor graphs have advantages over the filtering approach in 
1) capability to apply sparse optimization algorithms to solve large-scale problems, 
2) flexibility to accommodate asynchronous measurements, and 
3) improved robustness to highly non-linear systems. 
We investigate the performance of the proposed factor-graph-based BOD via simulations on low earth orbits, sun-synchronous orbits, and highly elliptical orbits.
