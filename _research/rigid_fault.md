We propose a novel fault detection framework for satellite constellations using inter-satellite ranging (ISR). Traditionally, navigation satellites can depend on a robust network of ground-based stations for fault monitoring. However, due to cost constraints, a comprehensive ground segment is impractical for lunar and Martian missions. Our approach leverages graph-rigidity theory to detect faults without relying on precise ephemeris. We model satellite constellations as graphs where satellites are vertices and inter-satellite links are edges. We identify faults through the singular values of the geometric-centered Euclidean distance matrix (GCEDM) of redundantly rigid sub-graphs.  <br><br>
